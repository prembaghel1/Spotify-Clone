# 🎵 Spotify Clone (Frontend Project)

A clean and responsive Spotify Clone built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project simulates a music streaming UI with playlist categories, album covers, and playback controls. It fetches songs dynamically from a structured folder using the `fetch()` API — **no localStorage** is used.
